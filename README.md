## Organizing: Where organizers make workshops happen. :boom:

We want to make workshop planning more visibile. The hope is that everyone can see what goes into each workshop, and can pitch in if something seems to be hanging. This is an experiment, and if it's terrible we'll go back to doing everything in secret, i.e. with email.

## To play along (and please do play along)
Start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues/new) for each workshop when you start organizing. It's awesome if the issue title includes a date, and location, as far as you know. (And you can always update the issue.)  CC your collaborators, make [todo lists](https://github.com/blog/1542-task-lists-in-gist) for everything that needs to be done, and add all the appropriate labels. Check out the [first one](https://github.com/railsbridge/organizing/issues/1) as an example! :bowtie:

Then, have conversation about the workshop as comments on the issues. Just make sure to not say confidential things, like people's phone numbers, because, the whole point of this is that **everyone can see** how we're organizing workshops. 

(Feel free to also create issues if this experiment is working or not working for you. :wink:)
